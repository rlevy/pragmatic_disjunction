\paragraph{Pr{\'e}cis}
The standard conception is that disjunctions \word{X or Y} must
involve terms \word{X} and \word{Y} that do not stand in a relation of
semantic inclusion \citep{Hurford:1974}.  However, this conception
runs afoul of two classes of empirically attested data: disjunctions
of terms in a one-way semantic inclusion relation such as \word{boat
  or canoe}, and disjunctions of synonymous terms like \word{wine
  lover or \textbf{oenophile}}, which are often felicitously used to
convey definitional information.  Here we show how both these classes
are naturally predicted by a novel recursive
probabilistic model of communication in which speakers and listeners
simultaneously exchange information about the world and about the
language they are using.

\paragraph{Disjointness implicatures}
\posscitet{Hurford:1974} generalization (HG) states the preference for
disjuncts to present mutually exclusive options. In actual usage, HG
is routinely violated (\citealt{Rohdenburg:1985}; for large corpora of
naturally occurring violations, see
\citealt{Potts13MICH,Chemla-HurfordCounts}).  However, the truth
behind HG is that such examples generate implicatures, and these can
be understood without recourse to HG:

\begin{itemize}
\item \tech{I-implicature}: the speaker worries that the listener will
  construe a general term as excluding a subkind due to salience or
  prototypicality. (Where \word{boat} tends to identify motorboats,
  the speaker might disjoin \set{\word{canoe}, \word{boat}} to ensure
  that canoes are included.)

\item \tech{Q-implicature}: the speaker worries that a specific term,
  which needs to be mentioned for some reason, will be construed
  exhaustively. (E.g., the speaker disjoints \set{\word{boss},
    \word{supervisor}} to highlight bosses while still giving the
  statement the needed generality.)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Definitional readings} Very different effects arise for
disjunctions of synonymous terms \citep{Horn89,Rohdenburg:1985}, as in
\word{wine lover or \textbf{oenophile}} and \word{\textbf{oenophile}
  or wine lover}. Such readings seem meta-linguistic, in that the
speaker seems to be teaching the listener about a word meaning. For
such readings to arise, it must be mutual, public knowledge that the
speaker is an expert in the relevant domain and the listener is not
(or cannot be presumed to be), and that the speaker has an interest in
conveying information about the language itself.

\paragraph{Model} The above pattern is attested in typologically and
geographically diverse languages, suggesting that it derives from the
basic semantics of disjunction. We capture it within a single
probabilistic model of pragmatic reasoning. The model's crucial
components are that it (i) allows a flexible relationship between
literal meanings and context-specific ``refined'' meanings, (ii)
preserves refined meanings through semantic composition, and (iii)
lets speakers communicate, not just about the world, but also about
the language \citep{Smith:Goodman:Frank:2013}.
\citet{bergen-levy-goodman:2014} show how (i)--(ii) suffice to account
for the Q- cases of disjointness described above; we show how they
also suffice to account for the I- cases.  We show that adding (iii)
preserves these results and permits definitional disjunction to arise
under precisely the circumstances described above. On this analysis,
the known disjunct serves as a \tech{focal point} that the speaker and
listener can coordinate on for the meaning of the unknown disjunct.
