\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
\item 

\item Extension: in \tech{definitional copular constructions}, the
  speaker defines the subject in terms of the object, or vice versa,
  as in examples like \word{Wine lovers are oenophiles} and
  \word{Oenophiles are wine lovers}.  Such examples are striking
  because predictions of this sort are generally used to ascribe
  contingent properties to objects, whereas definitional uses convey
  purely language-internal information and in fact are presumed not to
  ascribe new properties.

\item Extension: further attention to the precise way in which
  definitional uses are signaled.

\item Extension: human-subjects experiments and checking correlations
  with frequency as a measure of markedness.
